GM Push Fam, 

As we go further down our collective path of decentralization, hand-in-hand with our community, we’re opening up more and more of the ecosystem to be directly led by everyone involved.

To reach our goal of providing the future of comms and beyond for all, in a truly trustless environment, we need to double-down on championing the opinions of all involved in our ecosystem. 

We need to be not just collective tech for change, but a collective voice for change. 

That’s why today, we’re taking the next step towards Push being a truly collectively run ecosystem. 

We’re opening the doors of our blog to everyone in the greater Push ecosystem. 

### **Who qualifies?**

Everyone. 

Whether you represent a Push channel, a technical partner, a DAO contributor, a grantee, or something else entirely, this is your time.

Publish an opinion piece with us on one of the themes we’re looking for a the time, and reach our greater community of over 120,000 strong, while contributing to what the collective Push voice becomes. 

### What kinds of posts are we looking for?

Currently, we’re accepting ideas related to consumer crypto and improving coordination as well as UX in our industry, with more calls for articles to be added over time to the Push DAO Forum!
