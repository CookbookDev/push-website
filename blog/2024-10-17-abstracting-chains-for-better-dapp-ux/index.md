In the rapidly evolving landscape of Web3, user experience (UX) remains a pivotal factor in driving adoption and sustaining engagement. 

One of the key innovations and the current *hot* narrative of web3 aiming to improve the overall UX of web3 apps is **Chain Abstraction**.

Fundamentally, Chain Abstraction aims to create a seamless and intuitive experience for users and developers, by simplifying interactions across multiple blockchain networks, bridging the gap between complex blockchain mechanics and everyday usability. 

This article delves into the core concept of Chain Abstraction, explores its technical benefits, underscores its significance for the broader Web3 vision, and highlights what we at Push are doing to improve the UX of our applications.

## First, Let’s Understand Chain Abstraction

**Chain Abstraction** refers to the combined effort of hiding the complexities associated with interacting with multiple blockchain networks, allowing users and developers to engage with decentralized applications (dApps) without needing to manage the intricacies of each underlying chain. Essentially, it acts as an intermediary layer that simplifies cross-chain interactions, enabling seamless communication and functionality across diverse blockchain ecosystems.

The fundamental idea behind Chain Abstraction is to create a unified user experience that abstracts away the differences between various blockchain protocols. 

This means that users can perform actions on a dApp without having to switch networks, manage multiple wallets, or understand the technical nuances of each blockchain. By streamlining these interactions, Chain Abstraction aims to make Web3 more accessible and user-friendly, fostering broader adoption and sustained engagement.

## Enhancing Web3 dApp UX Through Chain Abstraction


### Simplified User Interactions

One of the primary benefits of Chain Abstraction is the simplification of user interactions with dApps. Currently, users often need to switch between different blockchain networks to access various functionalities, which can be cumbersome and deter non-technical users. 

Here is a quick glance at what the typical web3 user needs to deal with today in this multi-chain web3 ecosystem:

- *managing multiple wallets,*
- *managing multiple native tokens/assets in their multiple wallets,*
- *understanding the nuances of each network,*
- *navigating multiple networks to perform simple tasks,*
- *interacting with complicated dApp UIs with frequent network switching,*
- *navigate through inconsistent user interfaces,*
- *relying on the risky route of cross-chain bridging between chains,*
- *experiencing difficulty in maintaining a consistent cross-chain identity due to the multi-chain ecosystem,*
- *dealing with the lack of standardization between networks, protocols, etc.*
- *dealing with the learning curve of understanding different networks, each with its own set of rules, interfaces, and requirements.*

Remember that this is just a glance at the UX problem. There are undoubtedly more issues that an experienced web3 user faces daily. The list is even longer when it comes to newbie web3 users.

However, with Chain Abstraction, most of it gets abstracted away. 

In other words, chain abstraction shall allow users to only perform the bare minimum actions and delegate all others to specialized on-chain or off-chain actors. These actors can simply take the user’s intent and themselves figure out the best route, chain, transaction order, etc to fulfill the user’s request.

This means that the user can have a significantly simplified on-chain interaction where most of the multi-chain-specific complicated tasks will be abstracted away from them, thus improving the overall UX for an average Joe.

### Unified Wallet Management

Managing multiple wallets across different chains is another pain point for users. 

Chain Abstraction addresses this by enabling a single wallet interface that can interact with multiple blockchains. This reduces the cognitive load on users, allowing them to manage their digital assets more efficiently as well as more securely from a single platform.

### Seamless Cross-Chain Transactions

Chain Abstraction facilitates seamless cross-chain transactions, eliminating the need for manual bridging or swapping of assets. This not only enhances the speed and efficiency of transactions but also reduces the risk of errors and the potential security vulnerabilities associated with manual bridging processes.

### Enhanced Performance and Scalability

Chain Abstraction can also contribute to improved performance and scalability of dApps. By leveraging the strengths of multiple blockchains, dApps can optimize transaction speeds and reduce congestion on any single network. 

This distributed approach ensures that dApps remain responsive and efficient, even as user demand grows.

### Security and Reliability

While traditional interop or bridging solutions often introduce multiple points of vulnerability. For instance, the reliance on centralized validators or relayers can lead to potential breaches if these entities are compromised. Additionally, bridges typically depend on complex smart contracts and multi-signature schemes, which, if not meticulously audited, become prime targets for attackers. Historical incidents have underscored these risks, with a substantial portion of stolen crypto funds originating from bridge exploits. Most of the [massive crypto hacks](https://medium.com/immunefi/common-cross-chain-bridge-vulnerabilities-d8c161ffaf8f) in the past have occurred through compromised bridges, highlighting the critical need for more secure cross-chain solutions.

In contrast, Chain Abstraction minimizes these risks by shrinking down the attack surface area to a greater extent as it reduces direct user interactions with various chains. Instead of users navigating multiple networks and managing separate security protocols, Chain Abstraction delegates these responsibilities to specialized on-chain actors, such as intent handlers or solvers.

This delegation not only streamlines the user experience but also centralizes security oversight, allowing for more effective and consistent application of security measures. By handling transactions through a unified interface, Chain Abstraction can implement robust security protocols that ensure transactions are validated and processed securely across all supported chains.

However, it's important to recognize that Chain Abstraction introduces new points of security consideration. The addition of abstraction layers and off-chain components, like handlers or solvers, necessitates a reevaluation of the security framework. While these layers reduce the attack surface by limiting direct interactions with multiple chains, they also require their own stringent security measures. Ensuring the integrity and security of these new components is crucial, as any vulnerabilities within the abstraction layer could potentially compromise the entire system.

## The Importance of Chain Abstraction for Web3's Vision


Now that we understand what Chain Abstraction is, let’s quickly go over a few imperative points to understand why it matters.

### Streamlining User Onboarding

One of the biggest challenges facing Web3 is the complexity of onboarding new users. 

Chain Abstraction plays a crucial role in addressing this by providing a seamless entry point into the decentralized ecosystem. 

New users can interact with dApps without needing to navigate the complexities of different blockchain networks, making the transition from Web2 to Web3 smoother and more intuitive.

### Enhancing User Retention

A simplified and consistent user experience is key to retaining users in the long term. 

Chain Abstraction ensures that users can effortlessly engage with dApps across various chains, reducing friction and enhancing satisfaction. 

This leads to higher retention rates as users are more likely to continue using platforms that offer a seamless and hassle-free experience.

### Enabling a Diverse Range of Applications

Chain Abstraction opens the door to a broader spectrum of applications by enabling interoperability between different blockchains. 

Developers can build innovative dApps that leverage the unique features of multiple chains without being limited by the constraints of a single network. 

This fosters a more vibrant and diverse ecosystem, encouraging creativity and innovation in application development.

### Facilitating Cross-Chain Collaboration

In a multi-chain world, collaboration between different blockchain projects becomes essential. Chain Abstraction facilitates this by providing the necessary infrastructure for cross-chain communication and interoperability. 

This collaborative environment enables projects to share resources, data, and functionalities, driving collective growth and advancement in the Web3 space.

### Reducing Fragmentation

The decentralized nature of Web3 often leads to fragmentation, with various blockchains operating in silos. 

Chain Abstraction mitigates this by creating a cohesive ecosystem where different chains can interact seamlessly. This reduces fragmentation, promotes unity, and ensures that the benefits of decentralization are harnessed collectively rather than being diluted across disparate networks.

### Accelerating Mainstream Adoption

For Web3 to achieve mainstream adoption, it must offer a user experience that rivals traditional Web2 applications. 

Chain Abstraction is instrumental in bridging this gap by providing a seamless, intuitive, and efficient user experience that meets the expectations of mainstream users. 

By removing technical barriers and enhancing usability, Chain Abstraction paves the way for Web3 to become a ubiquitous part of everyday life.

## CCR: Push Protocol’s Crucial Move towards Enhancing UX


At Push Protocol, we have consistently focused on enhancing the user experience, not only for Push’s own community but also for the entire Web3 ecosystem.

Since the launch of our dApp, we have prioritized a [UX-driven](https://push.org/blog/the-rise-of-chains-and-fall-of-ux-in-web3-ux/) and security-first strategy. 

Whether we’re refining the visual interface, optimizing our smart contracts, or implementing gasless opt-ins for seamless dApp interactions, we remain dedicated to these principles across all facets of our platform.

However, improving UX in web3 involves far more than just building intuitive user interfaces for our applications. 

In a multi-chain ecosystem, users have to deal with a lot more complexities, as previously mentioned in this article.

Since Push Protocol supports more than one EVM chain (*and soon will support non-evm chains),* our dApp’s UX needs to be improved accordingly.

There is a need for us to ensure we abstract away all the multi-chain complexity for our users and provide a single unified interface for them to use.

And, we do this with the [**Cross Chain Request Feature.**](https://gov.push.org/t/pre-pip-3-cross-chain-request-feature-in-push-smart-contracts-v3/1794) 

### What is Cross Chain Requests (CCR)?

**Cross Chain Requests (CCR)** is a feature recently proposed in [Push Protocol’s Pre-PIP 3 governance proposal](https://gov.push.org/t/pre-pip-3-cross-chain-request-feature-in-push-smart-contracts-v3/1794). It aims to implement Cross Chain Requests within Push Protocol’s smart contracts, namely PushCore and PushComm. 

The CCR feature allows users to interact with the PushCore smart contract deployed on the Ethereum chain from any EVM or Non-EVM chain without the need to switch networks. Thus, providing an abstracted experience.

### How CCR Enhances dApp UX

**Seamless Network Interactions**

With CCR, users can perform essential actions such as [channel creation](https://app.push.org/channel/create), incentivized chat requests, and other arbitrary requests directly from their preferred blockchain. This eliminates the need to switch to Ethereum to interact with PushCore, thereby streamlining the user experience and reducing friction.

**Multi-Chain Compatibility**

CCR shall leverage [Wormhole’s Native Token Transfer (NTT) architecture](https://github.com/wormhole-foundation/example-native-token-transfers) and Relayers to enable secure cross-chain message and token bridging. 

This allows PushComm contracts deployed on various chains to relay requests to PushCore on Ethereum securely. 

Users can initiate actions from their native chains, enhancing the flexibility and convenience of interacting with Push Protocol.

By enabling seamless interactions from any chain, Push Protocol can attract users from various blockchain ecosystems. This broadens the platform’s user base, fostering a more interconnected and diverse community that benefits from enhanced interoperability.

**Simplified Channel Creation**

For instance, a user like Bob, who operates on Polygon, can create a channel on PushCore without leaving Polygon. By using PushComm’s *createChannel()* function, Bob can submit channel details and approve necessary tokens directly from Polygon. CCR ensures that the request is securely relayed to PushCore on Ethereum, where the channel is created without Bob needing to navigate complex cross-chain processes.

### Technical Improvements Through CCR

### Unified Contract Interactions

CCR centralizes the interaction logic within PushComm contracts deployed on multiple chains, enabling them to handle cross-chain requests effectively. This reduces the architectural complexity and ensures that PushCore remains secure and efficient without needing multiple deployments across different chains.

### Enhanced Security

By utilizing Wormhole’s NTT framework and Relayers, CCR ensures that cross-chain messages and token transfers are conducted securely. 

This minimizes the risk of vulnerabilities and enhances the overall reliability of cross-chain interactions, fostering greater user trust in Push Protocol’s solutions.

### Scalability and Efficiency

CCR allows Push Protocol to scale its operations across multiple chains without being limited by the constraints of a single blockchain. 

This scalability ensures that Push Protocol can accommodate a growing user base and diverse application needs, driving sustained growth and adoption.
